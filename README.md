# Instagram Follow Spy

</div>

![repository-template-button](./assets/insta-spy-banner.png)

A [web scraper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping) script for Instagram Web that allows you to find out who doesn't follow you and who you don't follow back, all through a pleasant and intuitive interface. You can also view the most recent analysis performed.

## Motivation

I took part as an instructor in a programming training program at a company where I worked. The focus of the challenge wasnâ€™t on the functionality itself, but rather on showing beginners how to manipulate the DOM using *Vanilla JS*, through web scraping techniques.

## Usage

In your browser, install a script manager extension.

Suggestions:

- [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io) - *Recommended*
- [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net)
- [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net) - *Firefox only*


### Install from GreasyFork (*Recommended*)

Go to the [script page on GreasyFork](https://greasyfork.org/pt-BR/scripts/541297-instagram-follow-spy), then click the "Install this script" button and follow the installation process in your extension.

### Install from GitHub

Click on file `script.user.js`, then click `Raw` button to install it.
